Our products include GitHub’s dependency scanning, secret scanning, and code scanning capabilities. Every day, developers unintentionally commit secrets into their repositories. Without intervention, this can cause damaging privacy and monetary losses. We’re solving that. For secret leaks in public repos we notify cloud providers automatically so they can take action. Try committing an AWS access key and secret to a public repo and you’ll receive a notification from AWS within seconds - we’re the team that makes that possible. For private repos we surface results directly to users. Recently we made push protection available to all users in public, extending our mission to put an end to credential based breaches. We’re looking for a software engineer to help accelerate our secret scanning product. You will join a remote, diverse, and passionate team.
