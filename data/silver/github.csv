Begins to determine additional critical metrics. Leads efforts and discussions for the technical solutions of products/features (e.g., design, cost). Creates proposals for architecture and design documents, and leads testing of hypotheses and proposed design solutions. Shares and acts on findings from investigations, owns design decisions, and oversees the less experienced team members. Leads the development of design documents for initiatives, determines the technology that will be leveraged, and how that technology will interact. Leads design discussions with internal, interdisciplinary, and crossfunctional teams and shares findings/learnings from investigations, holding ownership for design decisions. Leads efforts to ensure system architecture meets security and compliance requirements and expectations. May produce and/or ensure cross organizational alignment in contributions to the development of Engineering Design Reviews (EDR).

Monitors the health of the services to make data driven projections on scalability. Models and guides others to ensure safe deployments and monitors impacts to minimize disruptions, derisk rollouts, and develop rollback plans when needed. Leads by example and mentors others to produce extensible and maintainable code used across products and that is integrated with downstream dependencies. Leads efforts to optimize, debug, refactor, and reuse code to improve performance and maintainability, effectiveness, and return on investment (ROI). Identifies best practices and coding patterns and provides deep expertise in the coding and validation strategy. Creates and applies metrics to drive the quality and stability of code, as well as appropriate coding patterns and best practices. Leads efforts to apply knowledge of debugging tools, logs, telemetry, and other methods, and leads verification of assumptions. Writes and develops code proactively against issues before they occur and reinforce code as issues are identified across products. Leverages minimal telemetry data, triangulates issues, and resolves with minimal iterations. Leads retrospective debugging of solutions to identify patterns in root causes of problems, prevents future bugs across service areas, and reviews impact on other services for resolution. Provides technical leadership during code reviews for a solution/product area to ensure it meets the team's and GitHub's quality standards, is reliable and accurate, and is appropriate for the scale of the product feature. Ensures coding standards are followed. Screens for and establishes best practices in reviews and provides feedback on code to drive adherence to best practices.
