With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United States Overview GitHub is the home for software development, where we collaborate to build the world's leading AI-powered developer platform. In the GitHub code scanning team, we are passionate about ensuring the security and quality of the world’s software - from open source to the enterprise. We believe that the best way to secure and improve the quality of software is to detect actionable issues early in the development process, and actively facilitate their remediation as part of the developer workflow. Our team develops CodeQL and Copilot Autofix, detection and remediation engines that power the GitHub code scanning product, used by hundreds of thousands of developers and projects every day as part of GitHub's Advanced Security offering. CodeQL is GitHub's semantic code analysis engine that uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and correctness errors in software. CodeQL supports a wide range of programming languages, including C/C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, and Swift. Copilot Autofix is GitHub's LLM-powered remediation engine that produces high-quality fix suggestions for code scanning alerts, empowering developers to fix alerts as soon as they are found or that already exist in their codebase. We work as a distributed group within a distributed company. The majority of our team members live across Europe, the US, and Canada, and while we do have some offices, all our meetings are location-agnostic and happen online. We operate with a high degree of autonomy and trust, and we have a significant level of influence on the product and technical direction of CodeQL, code scanning, and the broader set of security products at GitHub. We value learning, introspection and reflection, and we’re always looking for ways to improve as a team and as individuals, so candor and a culture that values safety to speak up are highly important to us. Responsibilities We are looking for a Senior Software Engineer to join one of the distributed software engineering teams responsible for building and expanding the CodeQL and Copilot Autofix engines. In this role you will work in one of the following areas, selected based on your own experience and interests, and the needs of the organization at the time of hiring: Code analysis: Maintaining detection support for multiple programming languages, including: building source code extractors that translate code written in each language into data that CodeQL can understand, keeping up with the latest version of each supported language writing and maintaining queries in the CodeQL query language that accurately detect security vulnerabilities and undesirable coding patterns ensuring the quality of LLM-powered Copilot Autofix suggestions for fixing the alerts found building analysis libraries in the CodeQL query language that reason precisely about the semantics of programming languages, supporting the development of queries across all languages experimenting with and robustly evaluating LLM-powered detection engines and integration between LLMs and traditional static analysis. Foundations: Developing QL, the query language powering CodeQL analysis, and its underlying query compiler and evaluator within the CodeQL CLI. Expanding the expressive power of the CodeQL query language and speeding up the performance of the underlying query engine, empowering other teams to write high-quality analysis, and ensuring that CodeQL scales to the largest codebases in the world. Experiences: Developing the CodeQL CLI and the CodeQL Action, integrating CodeQL as a code scanning tool running in production in GitHub Actions, third-party CI systems, the command line, and the IDE. Copilot Autofix: Building, expanding, and robustly evaluating the Copilot Autofix engine, which uses LLMs and contextual information from code scanning alerts to produce AI-powered fix suggestions for those alerts. In any of the above tracks, you will work closely with various engineering teams, product managers, designers, and technical writers that build different aspects of the code scanning product, to influence product direction and deliver features to users, with clear focus on quality, reliability, and user experience. You will engage with internal users and external users (both from enterprise customers and the open-source community) to help them succeed with the product.
