Over 100 million people, including developers from 90 of the Fortune 100 companies, use GitHub to build amazing things together across 330+ million repositories. With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United States Overview GitHub is revolutionizing the way developers collaborate and build software, and we are looking for a Software Engineer to join the Primer Engineering team. Primer maintainers play a vital role in ensuring GitHub UI is consistent and accessible by supporting and improving the implementation and adoption of reusable design patterns. In this role, you’ll collaborate closely with designers and multidisciplinary teammates to grow and improve our component libraries; from designing a balanced component API to maturing components for stable release. You’ll also seek feedback from product and platform engineers to ensure a smooth and reliable developer experience, making it easier for consumers to build high-quality UI with Primer. If you enjoy the challenge of building design systems at scale and aim to deliver an equally empowering end user and developer experience, the Primer Engineering team at GitHub might be the place for you. For this specific role, we're looking for someone who values the following: Systems thinking: Our team has to apply decisions holistically, making sure to look at new patterns in context with the larger system of the product. Inclusive design: GitHub is a home for all developers and our design system should reflect that, which means including and learning from people with a range of perspectives and abilities. Designing and developing for inclusivity and accessibility first can open up our product for more people. Creating together: Getting to the best result is our focus. This may involve input and contributions from designers, engineers, and product partners working across both platform and product concerns – and ideally all of the above. Facilitating collaboration between disciplines and teams is key to evolving the design system alongside the needs of the product. Progress and impact: Our team often works on the meta, so it's easy to get caught up in the details. We have to be mindful of this and ensure we’re continuously driving toward decisions given the information available. This means being solutions oriented, seeking opportunities to ship iteratively, and prioritizing progress over correctness when it's the right call. Candidness: We encourage candidness and recognize its role in building trust between peers and leadership. It can take time and effort to get there, but it's worth it. Making decisions for projects, design patterns, and processes will yield better results when we can get to the “real talk.” Responsibilities Write, review and maintain code primarily in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. You will be a core contributor to Primer React, and may also push changes to our Rails library, Primer ViewComponents. Implementation complex UI components in our design system, including accessibility remediations and features. Work closely with designers to define component APIs, provide feedback, make recommendations, and propose improvements. Provide code review on internal and external contributions to the system. Document the systems you help build. Contribute to training and onboarding materials. Prototype, experiment, and create demos to find the right solutions. Triage and respond to issues and advocate for opportunities to improve service health. Partner with teams developing new features to share expertise and coach Primer adoption as projects move from conception to launch, with a view toward growing the product team’s systems thinking practices. Qualifications Required Qualifications You have a Bachelor's Degree (or higher, e.g., MS, or PhD) or its equivalent in Human-Computer Interaction Design, User Experience Design, Interaction Design, Graphic Design, Computer Science or a related field, or equivalent technical experience.. 1+ years experience as a software engineer contributing to design systems using one of the following coding languages or technologies: React, Typescript, Jest, Storybook, or ESLint 1+ years experience with WCAG compliance and/or implementing accessibility best practices 1+ years experience working with Git version control, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript Preferred Qualifications Experience working successfully with designers to implement and fine-tune complex UI Experience contributing to frameworks used by other engineers, such as internal or open source component libraries, styling systems, or utilities for developer experience.

In the GitHub code scanning team, we are passionate about securing the world’s software - from open source to the enterprise. We believe that the best way to secure software is to detect security issues early in the development process, and deliver a great user experience that engages, supports, and motivates developers to fix security vulnerabilities in a way that integrates naturally in their workflows. Our team develops and operates the code scanning product that’s part of GitHub’s Advanced Security offering. A central part of code scanning is CodeQL, GitHub's own semantic code analysis engine that uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and correctness errors in software. CodeQL currently supports a wide range of programming languages, including C/C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, and Swift.

You will write queries in the CodeQL query language to detect new security vulnerabilities with high precision, reduce the false negative rate of the existing analysis by building models of widely-used libraries and frameworks, and contribute your expert security knowledge to refine the LLM-powered autofix capabilities included in GitHub code scanning for alerts produced by CodeQL. Program analysis In this track, you will work primarily on the CodeQL default queries, analysis libraries, and CodeQL extractors that process source code, as part of a CodeQL language analysis team. You will ensure CodeQL works well across a wide variety of programming language versions, operating systems, build systems, and customer environments. You will build and maintain analysis libraries in the CodeQL query language that reason precisely about the semantics of programs in multiple supported languages. CodeQL foundations In this track, you will be part of the CodeQL Foundations team, and work primarily on QL, the query language powering CodeQL analysis, and its underlying query compiler and evaluator within the CodeQL CLI. You will expand the expressive power of the CodeQL query language and speed up the performance of the underlying query engine, empowering the other CodeQL teams to write high-quality analysis that scales to the largest codebases in the world. CodeQL experiences In this track, you will be part of the CodeQL Experiences team, and work primarily on the CodeQL CLI, the CodeQL Action, the CodeQL extension for Visual Studio Code, GitHub backend services and APIs, and AI-powered autofix and threat modeling capabilities. You will work on integrating CodeQL as a code scanning tool into GitHub Actions, third-party CI systems, the command line, and the IDE. You will be responsible for shipping and monitoring CodeQL in production, and making its analysis even more powerful through AI-powered autofix suggestions and elegant mechanisms for customization and threat modeling. In any of the above tracks, you will work closely with various engineering teams, product managers, designers, and technical writers that build different aspects of the code scanning product, to influence product direction and deliver features to users, with clear focus on quality, reliability, and user experience. You will engage with internal users and external users (both from enterprise customers and the open-source community) to help them succeed with the product.
