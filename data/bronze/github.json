Over 100 million people, including developers from 90 of the Fortune 100 companies, use GitHub to build amazing things together across 330+ million repositories. With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United Kingdom Overview GitHub is the home for software development, where developers collaborate to build some of the world’s most important software. In the GitHub code scanning team, we are passionate about securing the world’s software - from open source to the enterprise. We believe that the best way to secure software is to detect security issues early in the development process, and deliver a great user experience that engages, supports, and motivates developers to fix security vulnerabilities in a way that integrates naturally in their workflows. Our team develops and operates the code scanning product that’s part of GitHub’s Advanced Security offering. A central part of code scanning is CodeQL, GitHub's own semantic code analysis engine that uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and correctness errors in software. Come join our engineering team and help build CodeQL, GitHub’s first-party code scanning tool! You’ll belong to a distributed engineering team responsible for making CodeQL available to thousands of developers and hundreds of thousands of projects every day, by integrating it into GitHub Actions, third-party CI systems, the command line, and the IDE. You will build new features across a variety of products and systems, including the CodeQL CLI, the CodeQL Action, the CodeQL query libraries, the CodeQL extension for Visual Studio Code, GitHub core services, and AI-powered autofix and threat modeling capabilities. You will be continuously innovating to expand the core capabilities of CodeQL, building elegant customization mechanisms and integrations with machine learning to make its analysis even more powerful. Responsibilities You will work closely with other engineering teams that build different aspects of CodeQL analysis and the code scanning product, and help release their work into the hands of developers and security teams. You will engage with internal users and external users (both from enterprise customers and the open-source community) to help them succeed with the product. You will grow and scale the product, working as part of our Security Products group towards our mission of securing the world’s software. You’ll work closely with product managers, designers, technical writers, and engineers from multiple teams to influence product direction and deliver features to users, with clear focus on quality, reliability, and user experience. You’ll influence and provide feedback on the organizational culture and processes, always looking for opportunities to improve in a continuous pursuit for excellence.
