Over 100 million people, including developers from 90 of the Fortune 100 companies, use GitHub to build amazing things together across 330+ million repositories. With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United States Overview GitHub has changed the way software is built, and we have a unique opportunity to look further ahead to identify how software development can be faster, safer, easier, and more accessible. We’re looking for talented, experienced polymaths to join us in this mission! This is the rare role that affords both startup-level agency and a larger company’s resources. GitHub Next has incubated genre-defining products like Copilot, Copilot Workspace, and more. You’ll work closely with a small group of experienced and talented researchers to explore the future of software development. Our team’s prototypes inform GitHub’s leadership and roadmap. Each exploration represents a risky bet that GitHub might want to make, and we have to support those bets with working prototypes. Please note that this is not an academic research role. Our job is to dream big about the future of software development — and then build it. Our team feels like a permanent startup: every time we succeed, we hand off our prototypes and return to the drawing board to do it all over again. You can see many of our projects at githubnext.com. Responsibilities Research Engineers build prototypes. Sometimes, we have an interesting technological idea but need to figure out how to turn it into a reliable product. Other times, we dream of an experience, but we’re not sure how to make that experience a reality. With few constraints on our solution space, our hardest task is figuring out how to scope our bets and deliver value. We will have more ideas than we can possibly pursue; choosing wisely is part of the job. The exploration domains are varied and will require an ability to understand, investigate, and implement prototypes across a wide range of technologies. Our team has a lot of different skills under one roof, and we work together in squads to identify and debate ideas, then execute everything needed for a working prototype. For this role, we are seeking an individual with exceptional frontend and design skills. Next’s prototypes grapple with difficult UX challenges in domains with little prior art to guide us. You may be a good fit if: You are a generalist with some areas of deeper knowledge. Hybrids will feel at home on this team. We will also consider candidates who have specialized in a relevant field. You are an effective and inclusive communicator, comfortable with remote communication practices. Next’s currency is ideas; the health of our team, our execution, and our results rests on our ability to communicate well. You are comfortable collaborating with teammates to figure out what work needs doing, then splitting up that work and doing it. Ideating alone is natural and common, but projects staffed by one individual don’t tend to survive. Your teammates are the first ones you must persuade with your ideas.

Over 100 million people, including developers from 90 of the Fortune 100 companies, use GitHub to build amazing things together across 330+ million repositories. With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, Denmark Overview In the GitHub code scanning team, we are passionate about ensuring the security and quality of the world’s software - from open source to the enterprise. We believe that the best way to secure and improve the quality of software is to detect actionable issues early in the development process, and actively facilitate their remediation. This ensures that found alerts are fixed, and provides a great user experience that integrates naturally into developer workflows. Our team develops CodeQL and Copilot Autofix, two key components powering the code scanning product that’s part of GitHub’s Advanced Security offering, used by hundreds of thousands of developers and projects every day. CodeQL is GitHub's own semantic code analysis engine that uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and correctness errors in software. CodeQL currently supports a wide range of programming languages, including C/C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, Rust, and Swift. Copilot Autofix is our LLM-powered remediation system that produces high-quality fix suggestions for code scanning alerts, empowering developers to fix alerts as soon as they are found or that already exist in their codebase. Responsibilities In this role, you will join one of the distributed engineering teams responsible for building and expanding the core capabilities of code scanning with CodeQL and Copilot Autofix, in one of the following tracks: Code Analysis In this track, you will be part of a CodeQL language analysis team that maintains CodeQL support for multiple programming languages. You will help build source code extractors that parse and compile code written in each language, translating the source code into data that CodeQL can understand, and keeping up with the latest version of each supported language. You will write and maintain queries in the CodeQL query language that accurately detect security vulnerabilities and incorrect coding patterns, and ensure the quality of LLM-powered Copilot Autofix suggestions for fixing the alerts found. You will help build and maintain analysis libraries in the CodeQL query language that reason precisely about the semantics of programming languages, supporting the development of queries across all languages. CodeQL Foundations In this track, you will be part of the CodeQL Foundations team, and work primarily on QL, the query language powering CodeQL analysis, and its underlying query compiler and evaluator within the CodeQL CLI. You will expand the expressive power of the CodeQL query language and speed up the performance of the underlying query engine, empowering the other CodeQL teams to write high-quality analysis, and ensuring that CodeQL scales to the largest codebases in the world. CodeQL Experiences In this track, you will be part of the CodeQL Experiences team, and work primarily on the CodeQL CLI, the CodeQL Action, and LLM-powered Copilot Autofix capabilities. You will work on integrating CodeQL as a code scanning tool running in production in GitHub Actions, third-party CI systems, the command line, and the IDE. You will work on building, expanding, and robustly evaluating the Copilot Autofix engine, which uses LLMs and contextual information from code scanning alerts to produce AI-powered fix suggestions for those alerts. In any of the above tracks, you will work closely with various engineering teams, product managers, designers, and technical writers that build different aspects of the code scanning product, to influence product direction and deliver features to users, with clear focus on quality, reliability, and user experience. You will engage with internal users and external users (both from enterprise customers and the open-source community) to help them succeed with the product. You’ll influence and provide feedback on the organisational culture and processes, always looking for opportunities to improve in a continuous pursuit of excellence.
