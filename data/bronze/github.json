Over 100 million people, including developers from 90 of the Fortune 100 companies, use GitHub to build amazing things together across 330+ million repositories. With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, Denmark Overview GitHub is the home for software development, where we collaborate to build the world's leading developer platform. In the GitHub code scanning team, we are passionate about securing the world’s software - from open source to the enterprise. We believe that the best way to secure software is to detect security issues early in the development process, and deliver a great user experience that engages, supports, and motivates developers to fix security vulnerabilities in a way that integrates naturally in their workflows. Our team develops and operates the code scanning product that’s part of GitHub’s Advanced Security offering. A central part of code scanning is CodeQL, GitHub's own semantic code analysis engine that uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and correctness errors in software. CodeQL currently supports a wide range of programming languages, including C/C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, and Swift. Responsibilities Come join one of the distributed engineering teams responsible for building and expanding the code analysis capabilities of CodeQL, used by hundreds of thousands of developers and projects every day. In this role, you will continuously innovate to expand the core capabilities of CodeQL in one of the following tracks: Security Research In this track, you will work primarily on the CodeQL default queries and analysis libraries, as part of a CodeQL language analysis team. You will write queries in the CodeQL query language to detect new security vulnerabilities with high precision, reduce the false negative rate of the existing analysis by building models of widely-used libraries and frameworks, and contribute your expert security knowledge to refine the LLM-powered autofix capabilities included in GitHub code scanning for alerts produced by CodeQL. Program Analysis In this track, you will work primarily on the CodeQL default queries, analysis libraries, and CodeQL extractors that process source code, as part of a CodeQL language analysis team. You will ensure CodeQL works well across a wide variety of programming language versions, operating systems, build systems, and customer environments. You will build and maintain analysis libraries in the CodeQL query language that reason precisely about the semantics of programs in multiple supported languages. CodeQL Foundations In this track, you will be part of the CodeQL Foundations team, and work primarily on QL, the query language powering CodeQL analysis, and its underlying query compiler and evaluator within the CodeQL CLI. You will expand the expressive power of the CodeQL query language and speed up the performance of the underlying query engine, empowering the other CodeQL teams to write high-quality analysis that scales to the largest codebases in the world. CodeQL Experiences In this track, you will be part of the CodeQL Experiences team, and work primarily on the CodeQL CLI, the CodeQL Action, the CodeQL extension for Visual Studio Code, GitHub backend services and APIs, and AI-powered autofix and threat modeling capabilities. You will work on integrating CodeQL as a code scanning tool into GitHub Actions, third-party CI systems, the command line, and the IDE. You will be responsible for shipping and monitoring CodeQL in production, and making its analysis even more powerful through AI-powered autofix suggestions and elegant mechanisms for customization and threat modeling. In any of the above tracks, you will work closely with various engineering teams, product managers, designers, and technical writers that build different aspects of the code scanning product, to influence product direction and deliver features to users, with clear focus on quality, reliability, and user experience. You will engage with internal users and external users (both from enterprise customers and the open-source community) to help them succeed with the product. You will grow and scale the product, working as part of our Security Products group towards our mission of securing the world’s software. You’ll influence and provide feedback on the organizational culture and processes, always looking for opportunities to improve in a continuous pursuit of excellence.

With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United Kingdom Overview GitHub is the home for software development, where we collaborate to build the world's leading developer platform. In the GitHub code scanning team, we are passionate about securing the world’s software - from open source to the enterprise. We believe that the best way to secure software is to detect security issues early in the development process, and deliver a great user experience that engages, supports, and motivates developers to fix security vulnerabilities in a way that integrates naturally in their workflows. Our team develops and operates the code scanning product that’s part of GitHub’s Advanced Security offering. A central part of code scanning is CodeQL, GitHub's own semantic code analysis engine that uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and correctness errors in software. CodeQL currently supports a wide range of programming languages, including C/C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, and Swift. Come join one of the distributed engineering teams responsible for building and expanding the code analysis capabilities of CodeQL, used by hundreds of thousands of developers and projects every day. In this role, you will continuously innovate to expand the core capabilities of CodeQL in one of the following tracks: Responsibilities Security research In this track, you will work primarily on the CodeQL default queries and analysis libraries, as part of a CodeQL language analysis team. You will write queries in the CodeQL query language to detect new security vulnerabilities with high precision, reduce the false negative rate of the existing analysis by building models of widely-used libraries and frameworks, and contribute your expert security knowledge to refine the LLM-powered autofix capabilities included in GitHub code scanning for alerts produced by CodeQL. Program analysis In this track, you will work primarily on the CodeQL default queries, analysis libraries, and CodeQL extractors that process source code, as part of a CodeQL language analysis team. You will ensure CodeQL works well across a wide variety of programming language versions, operating systems, build systems, and customer environments. You will build and maintain analysis libraries in the CodeQL query language that reason precisely about the semantics of programs in multiple supported languages. CodeQL foundations In this track, you will be part of the CodeQL Foundations team, and work primarily on QL, the query language powering CodeQL analysis, and its underlying query compiler and evaluator within the CodeQL CLI. You will expand the expressive power of the CodeQL query language and speed up the performance of the underlying query engine, empowering the other CodeQL teams to write high-quality analysis that scales to the largest codebases in the world. CodeQL experiences In this track, you will be part of the CodeQL Experiences team, and work primarily on the CodeQL CLI, the CodeQL Action, the CodeQL extension for Visual Studio Code, GitHub backend services and APIs, and AI-powered autofix and threat modeling capabilities. You will work on integrating CodeQL as a code scanning tool into GitHub Actions, third-party CI systems, the command line, and the IDE. You will be responsible for shipping and monitoring CodeQL in production, and making its analysis even more powerful through AI-powered autofix suggestions and elegant mechanisms for customization and threat modeling. In any of the above tracks, you will work closely with various engineering teams, product managers, designers, and technical writers that build different aspects of the code scanning product, to influence product direction and deliver features to users, with clear focus on quality, reliability, and user experience. You will engage with internal users and external users (both from enterprise customers and the open-source community) to help them succeed with the product. You will grow and scale the product, working as part of our Security Products group towards our mission of securing the world’s software. You’ll influence and provide feedback on the organizational culture and processes, always looking for opportunities to improve in a continuous pursuit of excellence. Your application will be considered for each of the tracks above, based on your own experience and the availability of roles on our teams. Qualifications Minimum Qualifications: For this role, we’re looking for an experienced software engineer with: A few years of experience in software engineering or security research, with a high level of familiarity with Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, C++, C#, Rust, or a comparable programming language, and the interest and ability to learn additional languages as required and a high level of familiarity with one or more of the following areas: Software security, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, software supply chain security, or best practices in application security Experience building developer tools that operate on source code, such as compilers, parsers, static analyzers, debuggers, CLI tools, or IDE extensions Knowledge of compilers, program analysis, programming language design and implementation advanced knowledge of logic programming or database query languages (e.g. SQL, Prolog, Datalog, Kusto Query Language) Building integrations with CI/CD systems, such as GitHub Actions or Jenkins Machine learning applied to understanding source code, specifically using prompt engineering with large language models (LLMs) and systematic data collection and result evaluation Experience with the C++, Python, Go, Ruby, or Swift programming languages Preferred Qualifications: Strong applicants will also have: The ability to work with multiple stakeholders and teams across engineering, product, and design Experience operating user-facing software at scale, including availability and observability Experience working in a distributed team, operating effectively across multiple time zones (our teams span a wide time zone range from Pacific time to Central European time) A passion for fostering good engineering practices, tools, and processes GitHub values Customer-obsessed Ship to learn Growth mindset Own the outcome Better together Diverse and inclusive Manager fundamentals Model Coach Care Leadership principles Create clarity Generate energy Deliver success Who We Are GitHub is the world’s leading AI-powered developer platform with 100 million developers and counting.

Over 100 million people, including developers from 90 of the Fortune 100 companies, use GitHub to build amazing things together across 330+ million repositories. With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United States Overview GitHub is changing the way the world builds software, as the home for all developers! We’re looking for curious and empathetic engineers to join Git Systems – a critical organization in our Platform Engineering team. We are the Git teams at GitHub! Git Systems enables all Git Operations for GitHub dotcom. We maintain the various microservices, protocols, proxies, and GitHub’s fork of git. If you’ve ever run `git push` on your local machine to share changes on GitHub then you’ve interacted with our services and infrastructure. We serve billions of git requests daily; if you want to work at scale, Git Systems is an incredible opportunity! Git Systems is a highly distributed organization across Europe and North America comprised of 3 teams: Git Protocols, Git Platform, and Git Storage. Git Protocols provides external access by terminating all http and ssh requests. Git Platform serves and routes requests for access to git data. And finally, Git Storage stores, replicates, and hosts our git data. The 3 teams work in tandem, but this position is join the Git Storage team. Each team manages their own infrastructure to support their services, though we partner closely with our Infrastructure teams. To maintain high availability of our critical services we run a 24/7/365 on-call rotation. This is a shared rotation across our 3 teams, broken into two 12-hour shifts each day – one in North America and Europe respectively. Right now, our North America engineers have their on-call week, on average, once every 2 months. Engineers are expected to join the rotation within their first 6-9 months in the role. Want to know a little more about Git Storage? Storage is responsible for the persistent storage and replication of all repository data for Github dotcom. It is the infrastructure-heavy team in Git Systems, maintaining our fleet of file servers and MySQL databases that host 20+PiB of the world’s most valuable data. Git Storage also maintain GitHub’s backup and restore service and its data. Our team is directly responsible for the services that store and serve 450M+ Git repositories, both directly to users and to other layers in the GitHub software stack. Infrastructure experience is helpful for engineers on our team, but not a requirement. In this role you might work on extracting functionality from our Ruby on Rails monolith into greenfield Go microservices, work on distributed systems problems like ensuring a majority of repository replicas have persisted a push before returning success to a user or tackle scaling growth to ensure we keep ahead of our largest customer repositories. Examples of previous work within this group include: improving large monorepo performance, championing efficient ways of working with Git repositories and working on Git itself. Together we create the tools and products that are integral to how people build software. We pride ourselves on being thoughtful, intentional, and productive. We hope you are as well. Responsibilities Write, review, and maintain code primarily in Go and occasionally in Ruby Own and advocate for the health and quality of the systems that the team builds, including participating in on-call rotations and responding to availability incidents when necessary. Offhour pages are rare, but possible.
