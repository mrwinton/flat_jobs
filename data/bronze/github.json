Examples of past projects the team have undertaken include the development of over 850 CodeQL queries to cover various C/C++ Coding Standards for use in functional safety workflows in the automotive industry, the creation of a CodeQL development toolkit for supporting custom CodeQL development, working with customers to validate static contracts in C/C++ code using CodeQL and deploying cutting-edge AI technology in order to drive automatic remediation of security vulnerabilities. We also work to train customers in the use of CodeQL and help drive adoption through increasing library and framework coverage for our security queries. Responsibilities Develop creative bespoke solutions using CodeQL to help solve challenging customer problems Use CodeQL to develop static analyses to find vulnerabilities in our customers' code Refine and scale analyses so they can be run across 1000s of codebases Provide CodeQL training for developers and security engineers Support the product development and adoption of AI-powered CodeQL features, such as autofix, through customer engagements Be a trusted advisor for our customers on all aspects of CodeQL Qualifications Required Qualifications: Several years of experience as a software engineer, software consultant, or software security engineer and fluent in software development fundamentals (version control using git, pull request workflows etc.) or equivalent education in relevant fields Multiple years of experience in developing or customizing source code analysis tools, compilers, debuggers, IDE tools or similar and a strong understanding of programming language fundamentals Demonstrable ability with at least one of the languages supported by CodeQL (C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Kotlin, Swift and Go) Preferred Qualifications Implementing or working with static analysis, with a particular focus on taint tracking or abstract interpretation; or experience implementing high-level languages (interpreters or compilers) Logic Programming (Datalog, Prolog, CodeQL) or Functional Programming (Haskell, OCaml, Lisp, etc.) Secure coding practices and triaging common types of security vulnerabilities Relational database fundamentals Working directly with customers or stakeholders to scope, propose and implement technical solutions Mentoring and educating other engineers and disseminating complex technical ideas and processes GitHub values Customer-obsessed Ship to learn Growth mindset Own the outcome Better together Diverse and inclusive Manager fundamentals Model Coach Care Leadership principles Create clarity Generate energy Deliver success Who We Are GitHub is the world’s leading AI-powered developer platform with 100 million developers and counting. We’re also home to the biggest open-source community on earth (and 99% of the world’s software has open-source code in its DNA). Many of the apps and programs you use every day are built on GitHub. Our teams are dreamers, doers, and pioneers, leading the way in AI, driving humanitarian efforts around the globe, and even sending open source to Mars (and beyond!). At GitHub, our goal is to create the space you need to do your best work. We’re remote-first and offer competitive pay, generous learning and growth opportunities, and excellent benefits to support you, wherever you are—because we know that people flourish when they can work on their own terms. Join us, and let’s change the world, together.","location_name":"United Kingdom Remote","city":"Remote","country":"United Kingdom","country_code":"GB","location_type":"ANY","latitude":55.378051,"longitude":-3.435973,"categories":[{"name":"Engineering"}],"tags2":["UK-Remote"],"tags3":["Engineering"],"tags4":["Experienced Professional"],"tags5":["Individual Contributor"],"tags6":["Yes"],"promotion_value":0,"qualifications":"Required Qualifications: Several years of experience as a software engineer, software consultant, or software security engineer and fluent in software development fundamentals (version control using git, pull request workflows etc.) or equivalent education in relevant fields Multiple years of experience in developing or customizing source code analysis tools, compilers, debuggers, IDE tools or similar and a strong understanding of programming language fundamentals Demonstrable ability with at least one of the languages supported by CodeQL (C, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Python, Ruby, Kotlin, Swift and Go) Preferred Qualifications Implementing or working with static analysis, with a particular focus on taint tracking or abstract interpretation;
