Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United States Overview GitHub is revolutionizing the way developers collaborate and build software, and we are looking for a Software Engineer to join our Primer or Accessibility Engineering teams. These teams play a vital role in ensuring GitHub UI is consistent and accessible by supporting and improving the implementation and adoption of reusable design patterns. They also ensure that GitHub’s platform meets and exceeds accessibility standards, unblocking high-priority services and proactively addressing accessibility challenges across the product. In this role, you’ll collaborate closely with designers, engineers, and multidisciplinary teammates to grow and improve our component libraries, address accessibility concerns for complex UI patterns, and scale automated solutions for accessibility compliance. . You’ll also seek feedback from product and platform engineers to ensure a smooth and reliable developer experience, making it easier for consumers to build high-quality UI with our design system and accessibility best practices.

Inclusive design: GitHub is a home for all developers, and our work should reflect that by including and learning from people with diverse perspectives and abilities. Designing and developing for inclusivity and accessibility first opens up our platform for more people. Creating together: Achieving the best result involves contributions from designers, engineers, and product partners working across both platform and product concerns. Facilitating collaboration across disciplines and teams is key to evolving the design system and addressing accessibility challenges effectively. Progress and impact: Our team often works on the meta, so it's easy to get caught up in the details. We have to be mindful of this and ensure we’re continuously driving toward decisions given the information available. This means being solutions oriented, seeking opportunities to ship iteratively, and prioritizing progress over correctness when it's the right call.
