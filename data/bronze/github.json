Over 150+ million developers, including more than 90% of the Fortune 100 companies, use GitHub to collaborate and experiment across 420+ million repositories. With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United Kingdom Overview GitHub is the home for software development, where developers collaborate to build the world’s leading AI-powered developer platform. In the GitHub Code Scanning team, we are passionate about securing the world’s software - both Open Source and Enterprise. We believe that the best way to secure software is to detect security issues early in the development process, and actively facilitate their remediation as part of the developer workflow. Our team develops and operates the Code Scanning product that’s part of GitHub’s Code Security offering. Code scanning uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and other bugs that testing and day-to-day use have missed. This role will be involved in the design, rollout and support of highly performant, highly scalable, and highly available services to make found-means-fixed a reality with the power of Copilot Autofix. Responsibilities Come join our engineering team and help design, develop, and scale GitHub’s new Code Scanning feature. You’ll be working in a full-stack agile engineering team that’s part of the larger Code Scanning group working in Security Products.

In the Copilot Agents organization at GitHub, we are passionate about ensuring the security and quality of the world’s software - from open source to the enterprise, written by humans and by AI tools. We believe that the best way to secure and improve the quality of software is to detect actionable issues early in the development process, and actively facilitate their remediation as part of the developer workflow. Our team develops detection and remediation engines that power several GitHub products used by hundreds of thousands of developers and projects every day: CodeQL is GitHub's semantic code analysis engine that uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and correctness errors in software. CodeQL supports a wide range of programming languages, including C/C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, and Swift. It is used as the primary detection engine within the GitHub Code Security and GitHub Advanced Security products. Copilot Autofix is GitHub's LLM-powered remediation engine that produces high-quality fix suggestions for security or quality findings, empowering developers to fix them as soon as they are found or burn down the debt already existing in their codebase. It is used as the remediation engine within the GitHub Code Security, GitHub Advanced Security, and Copilot code review products. An LLM-based detection agent currently used as the primary detection engine within the Copilot code review product. We work as a distributed group within a distributed company. The majority of our team members live across Europe, the US, and Canada, and while we do have some offices, all our meetings are location-agnostic and happen online. We operate with a high degree of autonomy and trust, and we have a significant level of influence on the product and technical direction of security and code review products at GitHub. We value learning, introspection and reflection, and we’re always looking for ways to improve as a team and as individuals, so candor and a culture that values safety to speak up are highly important to us.
