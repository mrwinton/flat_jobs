Code scanning uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and other bugs that testing and day-to-day use have missed. Responsibilities The opportunity: Come join our engineering team and help design, develop, and scale GitHub’s new Code Scanning feature. You’ll be working in a full-stack agile engineering team that’s part of the larger code scanning group working in security products. You will work closely with various engineering teams, product managers, designers, and technical writers that build different aspects of the code scanning product, to influence product direction and deliver features to users, with clear focus on quality, reliability, and user experience. You will engage with internal users and external users (both from enterprise customers and the open-source community) to help them succeed with the product. You will grow and scale the product, working as part of our Security Products group towards our mission of securing the world’s software. You’ll influence and provide feedback on the organizational culture and processes, always looking for opportunities to improve in a continuous pursuit of excellence. What will your first 3 months look like? In the first week on the job, you’ll have deployed your first change to GitHub in production! After 30 days, you’ll be a core part of the team working together with your team-mates on changes and features that are key priorities for GitHub this year. Within the first three months, you’ll have had the opportunity to co-lead one or more features/product-changes that will be included in our next marketed product launch. We work as a distributed group within a distributed company. The majority of our team members live in Europe and on the east coast of the US, and while we do have some offices, all our meetings are location-agnostic and happen online. We operate with a high degree of autonomy and trust, and we have a significant level of influence on the product and technical direction of code scanning, as well as the broader security products at GitHub. We value learning, introspection and reflection, and we’re always looking for ways to improve as a team and as individuals, so candor and a culture that values safety to speak up are highly important to us.
