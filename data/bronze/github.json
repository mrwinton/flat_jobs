We’re building tools that make it easy to find, fix and prevent security vulnerabilities, and are deploying them to millions of developers. Our products include GitHub’s dependency scanning, secret scanning, and code scanning capabilities. Every day, developers unintentionally commit secrets into their repositories. Without intervention, this can cause damaging privacy and monetary losses. We’re solving that. For secret leaks in public repos we notify cloud providers automatically so they can take action. Try committing an AWS access key and secret to a public repo and you’ll receive a notification from AWS within seconds - we’re the team that makes that possible.
