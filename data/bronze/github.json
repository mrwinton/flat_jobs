With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United States Overview GitHub is the home for software development, where developers collaborate to build some of the world’s most important software. In the GitHub code scanning team, we are passionate about securing the world’s software - from open source to the enterprise. We believe that the best way to secure software is to detect security issues early in the development process, and deliver a great user experience that engages, supports, and motivates developers to fix security vulnerabilities in a way that integrates naturally in their workflows. Our team develops and operates the code scanning product that’s part of GitHub’s Advanced Security offering. A central part of code scanning is CodeQL, GitHub's own semantic code analysis engine that uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and correctness errors in software. Come join our engineering team and help build CodeQL, GitHub’s first-party code scanning tool! You’ll belong to one of the distributed engineering teams responsible for building and expanding the code analysis capabilities of CodeQL, used by hundreds of thousands of developers and projects every day. Responsibilities You will build new features across a subset of our products and systems, such as the CodeQL CLI, the CodeQL Action, the CodeQL default queries and analysis libraries, the CodeQL extractors that process code written in each supported language, the CodeQL extension for Visual Studio Code used by security researchers, GitHub core services, and AI-powered autofix and threat modeling capabilities. You will be continuously innovating to expand the core capabilities of CodeQL in one or more of the following areas: writing queries in the CodeQL query language to detect new security vulnerabilities writing analysis libraries in the CodeQL query language to reason more precisely about the semantics of programs in multiple languages reducing the false negative rate of the existing analysis by building models of widely-used libraries and frameworks, along with elegant customization and threat modeling tools ensuring CodeQL works well across a wide variety of programming language versions, operating systems, build systems, and customer environments expanding the expressive power of the CodeQL query language and the speed of the underlying query engine applying expert security knowledge to refine the LLM-powered autofix capabilities included in GitHub code scanning for alerts produced by CodeQL You will work closely with other engineering teams, product managers, designers, and technical writers that build different aspects of the code scanning product, to influence product direction and deliver features to users, with clear focus on quality, reliability, and user experience. You will engage with internal users and external users (both from enterprise customers and the open-source community) to help them succeed with the product.
