Over 100 million people, including developers from 90 of the Fortune 100 companies, use GitHub to build amazing things together across 330+ million repositories. With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, Denmark Overview GitHub is the home for software development, where we collaborate to build the world's leading developer platform. In the GitHub code scanning team, we are passionate about securing the world’s software - from open source to the enterprise. We believe that the best way to secure software is to detect security issues early in the development process, and deliver a great user experience that engages, supports, and motivates developers to fix security vulnerabilities in a way that integrates naturally in their workflows. Our team develops and operates the code scanning product that’s part of GitHub’s Advanced Security offering. A central part of code scanning is CodeQL, GitHub's own semantic code analysis engine that uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and correctness errors in software. CodeQL currently supports a wide range of programming languages, including C/C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, and Swift. Responsibilities Come join one of the distributed engineering teams responsible for building and expanding the code analysis capabilities of CodeQL, used by hundreds of thousands of developers and projects every day. In this role, you will continuously innovate to expand the core capabilities of CodeQL in one of the following tracks: Security Research In this track, you will work primarily on the CodeQL default queries and analysis libraries, as part of a CodeQL language analysis team. You will write queries in the CodeQL query language to detect new security vulnerabilities with high precision, reduce the false negative rate of the existing analysis by building models of widely-used libraries and frameworks, and contribute your expert security knowledge to refine the LLM-powered autofix capabilities included in GitHub code scanning for alerts produced by CodeQL. Program Analysis In this track, you will work primarily on the CodeQL default queries, analysis libraries, and CodeQL extractors that process source code, as part of a CodeQL language analysis team. You will ensure CodeQL works well across a wide variety of programming language versions, operating systems, build systems, and customer environments. You will build and maintain analysis libraries in the CodeQL query language that reason precisely about the semantics of programs in multiple supported languages. CodeQL Foundations In this track, you will be part of the CodeQL Foundations team, and work primarily on QL, the query language powering CodeQL analysis, and its underlying query compiler and evaluator within the CodeQL CLI. You will expand the expressive power of the CodeQL query language and speed up the performance of the underlying query engine, empowering the other CodeQL teams to write high-quality analysis that scales to the largest codebases in the world. CodeQL Experiences In this track, you will be part of the CodeQL Experiences team, and work primarily on the CodeQL CLI, the CodeQL Action, the CodeQL extension for Visual Studio Code, GitHub backend services and APIs, and AI-powered autofix and threat modeling capabilities. You will work on integrating CodeQL as a code scanning tool into GitHub Actions, third-party CI systems, the command line, and the IDE. You will be responsible for shipping and monitoring CodeQL in production, and making its analysis even more powerful through AI-powered autofix suggestions and elegant mechanisms for customization and threat modeling. In any of the above tracks, you will work closely with various engineering teams, product managers, designers, and technical writers that build different aspects of the code scanning product, to influence product direction and deliver features to users, with clear focus on quality, reliability, and user experience. You will engage with internal users and external users (both from enterprise customers and the open-source community) to help them succeed with the product. You will grow and scale the product, working as part of our Security Products group towards our mission of securing the world’s software. You’ll influence and provide feedback on the organizational culture and processes, always looking for opportunities to improve in a continuous pursuit of excellence.

With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United States Overview This team is responsible for evolving GitHub’s Elasticsearch infrastructure and elastomer-client code library feature sets. Platform Engineering maintainers play a vital role in ensuring GitHub search features are consistent and accessible by supporting and improving the implementation and adoption of Elasticsearch and the use of search features. In this role, you’ll collaborate closely with infrastructure / platform engineers and multidisciplinary teammates to grow and improve our search features, from designing a balanced elastomer-client library to maturing the Elasticsearch infrastructure for stable search experiences. You’ll also seek feedback from product and platform engineers to ensure a smooth and reliable developer experience, making it easier for consumers to build high-quality search functionality. If you enjoy the challenge of building highly scalable and available systems in a stable manner and aim to deliver an equally empowering end user and developer experience, the Platform Elasticsearch Engineering team at GitHub might be the place for you.

Systems thinking: Our team has to apply decisions holistically, making sure to look at new patterns in context with the larger system of the product. Inclusive design: GitHub is a home for all developers and our design system should reflect that, which means including and learning from people with a range of perspectives and abilities. Designing and developing for inclusivity and accessibility first can open up our product for more people. Creating together: Getting to the best result is our focus. This may involve input and contributions from designers, engineers, and product partners working across both platform and product concerns – and ideally all of the above. Facilitating collaboration between disciplines and teams is key to evolving the design system alongside the needs of the product. Progress and impact: Our team often works on long term stability, so it's easy to get caught up in the details. We have to be mindful of this and ensure we’re continuously driving toward decisions given the information available. This means being solutions oriented, seeking opportunities to ship iteratively, and prioritizing progress over correctness when it's the right call. Candidness: We encourage candidness and recognize its role in building trust between peers and leadership. It can take time and effort to get there, but it's worth it. Making decisions for projects, design patterns, and processes will yield better results when we can get to the “real talk.” Responsibilities Maintain the Elasticsearch infrastructure to ensure scale, availability, disaster recovery, maintainability and stability Write, review and maintain code primarily in Ruby, Go, React, HTML, and CSS.

Over 100 million people, including developers from 90 of the Fortune 100 companies, use GitHub to build amazing things together across 330+ million repositories. With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United States Overview GitHub is changing the way the world builds software, as the home for all developers! We’re looking for curious and empathetic engineers to join Git Systems – a critical organization in our Platform Engineering team. We are the Git teams at GitHub! Git Systems enables all Git Operations for GitHub dotcom. We maintain the various microservices, protocols, proxies, and GitHub’s fork of git. If you’ve ever run `git push` on your local machine to share changes on GitHub then you’ve interacted with our services and infrastructure. We serve billions of git requests daily; if you want to work at scale, Git Systems is an incredible opportunity! Git Systems is a highly distributed organization across Europe and North America comprised of 3 teams: Git Protocols, Git Platform, and Git Storage. Git Protocols provides external access by terminating all http and ssh requests. Git Platform serves and routes requests for access to git data. And finally, Git Storage stores, replicates, and hosts our git data. The 3 teams work in tandem, but this position is join the Git Storage team. Each team manages their own infrastructure to support their services, though we partner closely with our Infrastructure teams. To maintain high availability of our critical services we run a 24/7/365 on-call rotation. This is a shared rotation across our 3 teams, broken into two 12-hour shifts each day – one in North America and Europe respectively. Right now, our North America engineers have their on-call week, on average, once every 2 months. Engineers are expected to join the rotation within their first 6-9 months in the role. Want to know a little more about Git Storage? Storage is responsible for the persistent storage and replication of all repository data for Github dotcom. It is the infrastructure-heavy team in Git Systems, maintaining our fleet of file servers and MySQL databases that host 20+PiB of the world’s most valuable data. Git Storage also maintain GitHub’s backup and restore service and its data. Our team is directly responsible for the services that store and serve 450M+ Git repositories, both directly to users and to other layers in the GitHub software stack. Infrastructure experience is helpful for engineers on our team, but not a requirement. In this role you might work on extracting functionality from our Ruby on Rails monolith into greenfield Go microservices, work on distributed systems problems like ensuring a majority of repository replicas have persisted a push before returning success to a user or tackle scaling growth to ensure we keep ahead of our largest customer repositories. Examples of previous work within this group include: improving large monorepo performance, championing efficient ways of working with Git repositories and working on Git itself. Together we create the tools and products that are integral to how people build software. We pride ourselves on being thoughtful, intentional, and productive. We hope you are as well. Responsibilities Write, review, and maintain code primarily in Go and occasionally in Ruby Own and advocate for the health and quality of the systems that the team builds, including participating in on-call rotations and responding to availability incidents when necessary. Offhour pages are rare, but possible. Document architectural designs, carry out code experiments, and build prototypes to learn how we can achieve planetary scale with our systems Communicate with professionalism and empathy to best support our customers and community Model a culture of psychological safety both within the team and cross-team, where differing views can be shared and heard Qualifications Minimum Qualifications: 2+ years of professional software engineering experience 1 year of professional experience with distributed systems Demonstrable experience in Go – you know how to run production applications in a Linux or Unix environment Bachelor's degree or equivalent experience Preferred Qualifications: Infrastructure experience running containerized applications in production environments Excellent technical writing skills Experience working asynchronously with a distributed team across multiple time zones 1 year of experience working on a remote, distributed team Compensation Range The base salary range for this job is USD $75,000.00 - USD $198,900.00 /Yr.
