Our products include GitHub’s dependency scanning, secret scanning, and code scanning capabilities. Every day, developers unintentionally commit secrets into their repositories. Without intervention, this can cause damaging privacy and monetary losses. We’re solving that. For secret leaks in public repos we notify cloud providers automatically so they can take action. Try committing an AWS access key and secret to a public repo and you’ll receive a notification from AWS within seconds - we’re the team that makes that possible.

Over 100 million people, including developers from 90 of the Fortune 100 companies, use GitHub to build amazing things together across 330+ million repositories. With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United States Overview This team is responsible for evolving GitHub’s Elasticsearch infrastructure and elastomer-client code library feature sets. Platform Engineering maintainers play a vital role in ensuring GitHub search features are consistent and accessible by supporting and improving the implementation and adoption of Elasticsearch and the use of search features. In this role, you’ll collaborate closely with infrastructure / platform engineers and multidisciplinary teammates to grow and improve our search features, from designing a balanced elastomer-client library to maturing the Elasticsearch infrastructure for stable search experiences. You’ll also seek feedback from product and platform engineers to ensure a smooth and reliable developer experience, making it easier for consumers to build high-quality search functionality. If you enjoy the challenge of building highly scalable and available systems in a stable manner and aim to deliver an equally empowering end user and developer experience, the Platform Elasticsearch Engineering team at GitHub might be the place for you. What we're looking for: Experienced Engineers at GitHub are strong individual contributors; they're given a lot of autonomy and trust to work on high impact projects. For this specific role, we're looking for someone who values the following: Specific Elasticsearch Platform Experience - Our team’s mission is related very specifically to the Elasticsearch platform. This role needs to have previous deep experience with this search platform. Systems thinking: Our team has to apply decisions holistically, making sure to look at new patterns in context with the larger system of the product. Inclusive design: GitHub is a home for all developers and our design system should reflect that, which means including and learning from people with a range of perspectives and abilities. Designing and developing for inclusivity and accessibility first can open up our product for more people. Creating together: Getting to the best result is our focus. This may involve input and contributions from designers, engineers, and product partners working across both platform and product concerns – and ideally all of the above. Facilitating collaboration between disciplines and teams is key to evolving the design system alongside the needs of the product. Progress and impact: Our team often works on long term stability, so it's easy to get caught up in the details. We have to be mindful of this and ensure we’re continuously driving toward decisions given the information available. This means being solutions oriented, seeking opportunities to ship iteratively, and prioritizing progress over correctness when it's the right call. Candidness: We encourage candidness and recognize its role in building trust between peers and leadership. It can take time and effort to get there, but it's worth it. Making decisions for projects, design patterns, and processes will yield better results when we can get to the “real talk.” Responsibilities Maintain the Elasticsearch infrastructure to ensure scale, availability, disaster recovery, maintainability and stability Write, review and maintain code primarily in Ruby, Go, React, HTML, and CSS. You will be a core contributor to the elastomer-client features and may also push changes to our Ruby / React library Lead the implementation and maturation of complex UI components in our design system, including accessibility remediations and features. Work closely with internal clients to define automation against Elasticsearch APIs, provide feedback, make recommendations, and propose improvements. Provide code review on internal and external contributions to the system. Document the systems you help build. Contribute to training and onboarding materials.
