Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United States Overview GitHub is revolutionizing the way developers collaborate and build software, and we are looking for a Software Engineer to join the Primer Engineering team. Primer maintainers play a vital role in ensuring GitHub UI is consistent and accessible by supporting and improving the implementation and adoption of reusable design patterns. In this role, you’ll collaborate closely with designers and multidisciplinary teammates to grow and improve our component libraries; from designing a balanced component API to maturing components for stable release. You’ll also seek feedback from product and platform engineers to ensure a smooth and reliable developer experience, making it easier for consumers to build high-quality UI with Primer.

Facilitating collaboration between disciplines and teams is key to evolving the design system alongside the needs of the product. Progress and impact: Our team often works on the meta, so it's easy to get caught up in the details. We have to be mindful of this and ensure we’re continuously driving toward decisions given the information available. This means being solutions oriented, seeking opportunities to ship iteratively, and prioritizing progress over correctness when it's the right call. Candidness: We encourage candidness and recognize its role in building trust between peers and leadership. It can take time and effort to get there, but it's worth it. Making decisions for projects, design patterns, and processes will yield better results when we can get to the “real talk.” Responsibilities Write, review and maintain code primarily in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United States Overview GitHub is changing the way the world builds software, as the home for all developers! We’re looking for curious and empathetic engineers to join Git Systems – a critical organization in our Platform Engineering team. We are the Git teams at GitHub! Git Systems enables all Git Operations for GitHub dotcom. We maintain the various microservices, protocols, proxies, and GitHub’s fork of git. If you’ve ever run `git push` on your local machine to share changes on GitHub then you’ve interacted with our services and infrastructure. We serve billions of git requests daily; if you want to work at scale, Git Systems is an incredible opportunity! Git Systems is a highly distributed organization across Europe and North America comprised of 3 teams: Git Protocols, Git Platform, and Git Storage. Git Protocols provides external access by terminating all http and ssh requests. Git Platform serves and routes requests for access to git data. And finally, Git Storage stores, replicates, and hosts our git data. The 3 teams work in tandem, but this position is join the Git Storage team. Each team manages their own infrastructure to support their services, though we partner closely with our Infrastructure teams. To maintain high availability of our critical services we run a 24/7/365 on-call rotation. This is a shared rotation across our 3 teams, broken into two 12-hour shifts each day – one in North America and Europe respectively. Right now, our North America engineers have their on-call week, on average, once every 2 months. Engineers are expected to join the rotation within their first 6-9 months in the role. Want to know a little more about Git Storage? Storage is responsible for the persistent storage and replication of all repository data for Github dotcom. It is the infrastructure-heavy team in Git Systems, maintaining our fleet of file servers and MySQL databases that host 20+PiB of the world’s most valuable data. Git Storage also maintain GitHub’s backup and restore service and its data. Our team is directly responsible for the services that store and serve 450M+ Git repositories, both directly to users and to other layers in the GitHub software stack. Infrastructure experience is helpful for engineers on our team, but not a requirement. In this role you might work on extracting functionality from our Ruby on Rails monolith into greenfield Go microservices, work on distributed systems problems like ensuring a majority of repository replicas have persisted a push before returning success to a user or tackle scaling growth to ensure we keep ahead of our largest customer repositories. Examples of previous work within this group include: improving large monorepo performance, championing efficient ways of working with Git repositories and working on Git itself. Together we create the tools and products that are integral to how people build software. We pride ourselves on being thoughtful, intentional, and productive. We hope you are as well. Responsibilities Write, review, and maintain code primarily in Go and occasionally in Ruby Own and advocate for the health and quality of the systems that the team builds, including participating in on-call rotations and responding to availability incidents when necessary.

With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, Denmark Overview GitHub is the home for software development, where we collaborate to build the world's leading developer platform. In the GitHub code scanning team, we are passionate about securing the world’s software - from open source to the enterprise. We believe that the best way to secure software is to detect security issues early in the development process, and deliver a great user experience that engages, supports, and motivates developers to fix security vulnerabilities in a way that integrates naturally in their workflows. Our team develops and operates the code scanning product that’s part of GitHub’s Advanced Security offering. A central part of code scanning is CodeQL, GitHub's own semantic code analysis engine that uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and correctness errors in software. CodeQL currently supports a wide range of programming languages, including C/C++, C#, Go, Java, JavaScript/TypeScript, Kotlin, Python, Ruby, and Swift. Come join one of the distributed engineering teams responsible for building and expanding the code analysis capabilities of CodeQL, used by hundreds of thousands of developers and projects every day.
