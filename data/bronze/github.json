With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United States Overview GitHub is changing the way the world builds software, as the home for all developers! We’re looking for curious and empathetic engineers to join Git Systems – a critical organization in our Platform Engineering team. We are the Git teams at GitHub! Git Systems enables all Git Operations for GitHub dotcom. We maintain the various microservices, protocols, proxies, and GitHub’s fork of git. If you’ve ever run `git push` on your local machine to share changes on GitHub then you’ve interacted with our services and infrastructure. We serve billions of git requests daily; if you want to work at scale, Git Systems is an incredible opportunity! Git Systems is a highly distributed organization across Europe and North America composed of 3 teams: Git Protocols, Git Platform, and Git Storage. Git Protocols provides external access by terminating all http and ssh requests. Git Platform serves and routes requests for access to git data. And finally, Git Storage stores, replicates, and hosts our git data. The 3 teams work in tandem, but this position is in the Git Storage team. Each team manages their own infrastructure to support their services, though we partner closely with our Infrastructure teams. To maintain high availability of our critical services we run a 24/7/365 on-call rotation. This is a shared rotation across our 3 teams, broken into two 12-hour shifts each day – one in North America and Europe respectively. Right now, our North America engineers have their on-call week, on average, once every 2 months. Senior Engineers are expected to join the rotation within their first 6 months in the role. Want to know a little more about Git Storage? Storage is responsible for the persistent storage and replication of all repository data for Github dotcom. It is the infrastructure-heavy team in Git Systems, maintaining our fleet of file servers and MySQL databases that host 20+PiB of the world’s most valuable data. Git Storage also maintains GitHub’s backup and restore service and its data. Our team is directly responsible for the services that store and serve 450M+ Git repositories, both directly to users and to other layers in the GitHub software stack. Infrastructure experience is helpful for engineers on our team, but not a requirement. In this role you might work on extracting functionality from our Ruby on Rails monolith into greenfield Go microservices, work on distributed systems problems like ensuring a majority of repository replicas have persisted a push before returning success to a user or tackle scaling growth to ensure we keep ahead of our largest customer repositories. Examples of previous work within this group include: improving large monorepo performance, championing efficient ways of working with Git repositories and working on Git itself. Together we create the tools and products that are integral to how people build software. We pride ourselves on being thoughtful, intentional, and productive. We hope you are as well. Responsibilities Write, review, and maintain code primarily in Go and occasionally in Ruby Own and advocate for the health and quality of the systems that the team builds, including participating in on-call rotations and responding to availability incidents when necessary. Offhour pages are rare, but possible. Document architectural designs, carry out code experiments, and build prototypes to learn how we can achieve planetary scale with our systems Provide technical direction, mentorship, pairing opportunities, and code reviews to encourage the growth of others Communicate with professionalism and empathy to best support our customers and community Model a culture of psychological safety both within the team and cross-team, where differing views can be shared and heard Qualifications Minimum Qualifications: 6+ years of professional software engineering experience 1+ year of experience working on a remote, distributed team 1+ year of professional experience with distributed systems Demonstrable experience in Go – you know how to run production applications in a Linux or Unix environment Bachelor's degree or equivalent experience Preferred Qualifications: Interest in or experience with the internals of Git Experience building highly available systems at scale Infrastructure experience running containerized applications in production environments Excellent technical writing skills Experience working asynchronously with a distributed team across multiple time zones Compensation Range The base salary range for this job is USD $104,400.00 - USD $276,900.00 /Yr.

In the GitHub code scanning team, we are passionate about securing the world’s software - from open source to the enterprise. We believe that the best way to secure software is to detect security issues early in the development process, and deliver a great user experience that engages, supports, and motivates developers to fix security vulnerabilities in a way that integrates naturally in their workflows. Our team develops and operates the new code scanning product that’s part of GitHub’s Advanced Security offering. Code scanning uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and other bugs that testing and day-to-day use have missed.
