github,2725,"Staff Software Engineer, Code QL",US Remote,https://careers-githubinc.icims.com/jobs/2725/login,"About GitHub As the global home for all developers, GitHub is the complete AI-powered developer platform to build, scale, and deliver secure software. Over 100 million people, including developers from 90 of the Fortune 100 companies, use GitHub to build amazing things together across 330+ million repositories. With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United States Overview GitHub is the home for software development, where developers collaborate to build some of the world’s most important software. In the GitHub code scanning team, we are passionate about securing the world’s software - from open source to the enterprise. We believe that the best way to secure software is to detect security issues early in the development process, and deliver a great user experience that engages, supports, and motivates developers to fix security vulnerabilities in a way that integrates naturally in their workflows. Our team develops and operates the code scanning product that’s part of GitHub’s Advanced Security offering. A central part of code scanning is CodeQL, GitHub's own semantic code analysis engine that uses world-class static analysis research and technology to deeply analyze code, enabling the early detection of security vulnerabilities and correctness errors in software. Come join our engineering team and help build CodeQL, GitHub’s first-party code scanning tool! You’ll belong to one of the distributed engineering teams responsible for building and expanding the code analysis capabilities of CodeQL, used by hundreds of thousands of developers and projects every day. Responsibilities You will build new features across a subset of our products and systems, such as the CodeQL CLI, the CodeQL Action, the CodeQL default queries and analysis libraries, the CodeQL extractors that process code written in each supported language, the CodeQL extension for Visual Studio Code used by security researchers, GitHub core services, and AI-powered autofix and threat modeling capabilities. You will be continuously innovating to expand the core capabilities of CodeQL in one or more of the following areas: writing queries in the CodeQL query language to detect new security vulnerabilities writing analysis libraries in the CodeQL query language to reason more precisely about the semantics of programs in multiple languages reducing the false negative rate of the existing analysis by building models of widely-used libraries and frameworks, along with elegant customization and threat modeling tools ensuring CodeQL works well across a wide variety of programming language versions, operating systems, build systems, and customer environments expanding the expressive power of the CodeQL query language and the speed of the underlying query engine applying expert security knowledge to refine the LLM-powered autofix capabilities included in GitHub code scanning for alerts produced by CodeQL You will work closely with other engineering teams, product managers, designers, and technical writers that build different aspects of the code scanning product, to influence product direction and deliver features to users, with clear focus on quality, reliability, and user experience. You will engage with internal users and external users (both from enterprise customers and the open-source community) to help them succeed with the product. You will grow and scale the product, working as part of our Security Products group towards our mission of securing the world’s software. You’ll influence and provide feedback on the organizational culture and processes, always looking for opportunities to improve in a continuous pursuit for excellence. Qualifications Minimum Qualifications: For this role, we’re looking for an experienced software engineer with: 7+ years of experience in software engineering or security research, with a high level of familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C++, or a comparable programming language, and the interest and ability to learn additional languages as required and a high level of familiarity with one or more of the following areas: software security, including static analysis, dynamic analysis, software supply chain security, or best practices in application security experience building developer tools that operate on source code, such as compilers, parsers, static analyzers, debuggers, CLI tools, or IDE extensions knowledge of compilers, logic programming or database query languages (e.g. SQL, Prolog, Datalog, Kusto Query Language), program analysis, programming language design and implementation building integrations with CI/CD systems, such as GitHub Actions or Jenkins machine learning, including large language models (LLMs) and prompt engineering, applying machine learning to understanding source code, systematic data collection and result evaluation operating user-facing software at scale, including availability and observability experience with the Python, Go, Ruby, C#, or Rust programming languages Preferred Qualifications: Strong applicants will have a high level of familiarity with two or more areas in the above list, as well as: the ability to work with multiple stakeholders and teams across engineering, product, and design excellent verbal and written communication skills experience working in a distributed team, operating effectively across multiple time zones (our teams span a wide time zone range from Pacific time to Central European time) a passion for fostering good engineering practices, tools, and processes Compensation Range USD $118,100.00 - USD $313,300.00 /Yr.
