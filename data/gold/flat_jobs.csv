github,3010,"Software Engineer III, Elasticsearch",US Remote,https://careers-githubinc.icims.com/jobs/3010/login,"About GitHub As the global home for all developers, GitHub is the complete AI-powered developer platform to build, scale, and deliver secure software. Over 100 million people, including developers from 90 of the Fortune 100 companies, use GitHub to build amazing things together across 330+ million repositories. With all the collaborative features of GitHub, it has never been easier for individuals and teams to write faster, better code. Locations In this role you can work from Remote, United States Overview This team is responsible for evolving GitHub’s Elasticsearch infrastructure and elastomer-client code library feature sets. Platform Engineering maintainers play a vital role in ensuring GitHub search features are consistent and accessible by supporting and improving the implementation and adoption of Elasticsearch and the use of search features. In this role, you’ll collaborate closely with infrastructure / platform engineers and multidisciplinary teammates to grow and improve our search features, from designing a balanced elastomer-client library to maturing the Elasticsearch infrastructure for stable search experiences. You’ll also seek feedback from product and platform engineers to ensure a smooth and reliable developer experience, making it easier for consumers to build high-quality search functionality. If you enjoy the challenge of building highly scalable and available systems in a stable manner and aim to deliver an equally empowering end user and developer experience, the Platform Elasticsearch Engineering team at GitHub might be the place for you. What we're looking for: Experienced Engineers at GitHub are strong individual contributors; they're given a lot of autonomy and trust to work on high impact projects. For this specific role, we're looking for someone who values the following: Specific Elasticsearch Platform Experience - Our team’s mission is related very specifically to the Elasticsearch platform. This role needs to have previous deep experience with this search platform. Systems thinking: Our team has to apply decisions holistically, making sure to look at new patterns in context with the larger system of the product. Inclusive design: GitHub is a home for all developers and our design system should reflect that, which means including and learning from people with a range of perspectives and abilities. Designing and developing for inclusivity and accessibility first can open up our product for more people. Creating together: Getting to the best result is our focus. This may involve input and contributions from designers, engineers, and product partners working across both platform and product concerns – and ideally all of the above. Facilitating collaboration between disciplines and teams is key to evolving the design system alongside the needs of the product. Progress and impact: Our team often works on long term stability, so it's easy to get caught up in the details. We have to be mindful of this and ensure we’re continuously driving toward decisions given the information available. This means being solutions oriented, seeking opportunities to ship iteratively, and prioritizing progress over correctness when it's the right call. Candidness: We encourage candidness and recognize its role in building trust between peers and leadership. It can take time and effort to get there, but it's worth it. Making decisions for projects, design patterns, and processes will yield better results when we can get to the “real talk.” Responsibilities Maintain the Elasticsearch infrastructure to ensure scale, availability, disaster recovery, maintainability and stability Write, review and maintain code primarily in Ruby, Go, React, HTML, and CSS. You will be a core contributor to the elastomer-client features and may also push changes to our Ruby / React library Lead the implementation and maturation of complex UI components in our design system, including accessibility remediations and features. Work closely with internal clients to define automation against Elasticsearch APIs, provide feedback, make recommendations, and propose improvements. Provide code review on internal and external contributions to the system. Document the systems you help build. Contribute to training and onboarding materials. Prototype, experiment, and create demos to find the right solutions. Participate in on-call rotations with your team. Triage and respond to issues and advocate for opportunities to improve service health. Partner with select teams developing new features to share expertise and coach search adoption as projects move from conception to launch, with a view toward growing the product team’s systems thinking practices. Qualifications Minimum Qualifications: 2+ years of infrastructure experience including Terraform, Ansible, Puppet and Azure 2+ years of Elasticsearch and search integration 2+ years of experience as an engineer contributing to design systems 4+ years of engineering experience as an individual contributor Preferred Qualifications: Think of this list as a descriptive sketch, not a checklist of requirements. Be comfortable applying even if you don’t have all of them. You have led development of or contributed to frameworks used by other engineers, such as internal or open source component libraries, styling systems, or utilities for developer experience. You are familiar with developing in Ruby on Rails and/or the ViewComponent framework, and feel comfortable pushing Rails code. You have experience analyzing or auditing code for accessibility issues. You have experience working on developer tools and/or a developer-focused product. 4+ years of using Git version control and confident in working with CSS, HTML, and JavaScript You are knowledgeable and experienced in leading the implementation of complex components for multiple use cases within a website or application, preferably with Ruby, React and associated tooling which may include TypeScript, Jest, Storybook, and ESLint Compensation Range The base salary range for this job is USD $90,700.00 - USD $240,500.00 /Yr.
